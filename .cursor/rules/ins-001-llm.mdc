description: LOCKED - LLM model defines construct validity for LLM Alignment metric. DO NOT CHANGE MODEL.

# Overview

## DO NOT change the model

```python
# ✅ REQUIRED - Claude Haiku 4.5 only
MODEL = "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"

# ❌ FORBIDDEN - Any other model
MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"  # NO
MODEL = "claude-3-opus"  # NO
MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"  # NO
```

## Why This Matters

The LLM Alignment metric measures whether users "think like the statistical average."
Changing the model changes what "statistical average" means, invalidating:
- All historical LLM convergence scores
- All archetype classifications
- Research validity

## Prompt Safety

User clues are validated AND XML-escaped:

```python
# ✅ REQUIRED
escaped_clues = [html.escape(c) for c in clues]
clue_xml = "\n".join(f"  <clue>{c}</clue>" for c in escaped_clues)
```

Never put raw user input directly in prompts.

## Temperature

```python
# ✅ REQUIRED
max_tokens=100,  # Keep responses short

# Temperature is set in config.py as LLM_TEMPERATURE = 0.3
```

## If Changes Seem Needed

1. STOP
2. Explain to user why change seems necessary
3. Document impact on construct validity
4. Get explicit approval
5. Update DECISION-HISTORY.md
