# Overview

## DO NOT modify existing field names

The field names in models.py are the API contract with the frontend.
Changing them breaks the client.

## Adding New Fields

If you need to add a field:
1. ASK USER first
2. Make it Optional with a default
3. Document the addition

```python
# ✅ Safe addition
class GameResponse(BaseModel):
    existing_field: str
    new_field: Optional[str] = None  # Added for X reason
```

## Removing Fields

❌ NEVER remove fields without user approval.
This will break frontend code.

## Renaming Fields

❌ NEVER rename fields.
Add a new field, deprecate the old one.

## Enums

```python
# These are locked
class RecipientType(str, Enum):
    NETWORK = "network"
    STRANGER = "stranger"
    LLM = "llm"

class GameStatus(str, Enum):
    PENDING_CLUES = "pending_clues"
    PENDING_GUESS = "pending_guess"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
    EXPIRED = "expired"
```

Do not add/remove/rename enum values without explicit approval.

## Cross-Reference

When touching models.py, check ALL files that import from it:
- games.py
- users.py (pending)
- share.py (pending)
- Any route handler
